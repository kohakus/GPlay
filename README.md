# GPlay

This is a graphics playground for practising and experimenting with fun graphics techniques, including rendering as well as simulation, procedural modeling and animation.

Due to the difficulty of naming, I have used a museum approach to naming each directory/experiment, substituting the names of various types of creatures.
